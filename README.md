# Rent App

A platform connecting college students and local landlords to streamline the off-campus housing search process.

## Overview

Community aims to solve the problem of students struggling to find suitable off-campus housing and landlords having difficulty reaching their target market and managing rental applications. This platform allows students to create profiles, search for housing based on their preferences, and submit rental applications. Landlords can list their properties, review applications, and communicate with potential tenants.

The inspiration for this project comes from the difficulties faced by students and landlords during the off-campus housing search process.
